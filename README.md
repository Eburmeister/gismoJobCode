# gismoJobCode
Python scripts for scheduled server jobs.
Initially created 10-8-2018


This repository is for python scripts that are used to update various databases.

Note: These scripts were initially renamed to follow a consistent naming convention and do not necessarily match current server job names.

Naming Convention:
XXXX_yyyy (Department, job name)

Scripts with "_task" should be used in Task Scheduler.  They fire off other dependent scripts.
